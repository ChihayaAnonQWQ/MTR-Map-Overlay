MTR Map Overlay adds Minecraft Transit Railway routes, physical rails and map-only landmarks to Xaero's World Map and JourneyMap. **v1.5.1 supports Minecraft 1.20.1 and 1.20.4 on Forge or Fabric, and 1.21.1 on NeoForge or Fabric.** It reads [Minecraft Transit Railway (MTR)](https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway) data directly and does not depend on MTR Surveyor's map.

## Features

| Map | Overlay |
| --- | --- |
| Xaero's World Map | Physical rail geometry, route-coloured ribbons, and compact station, platform and depot icons. Hover to inspect routes and landmarks. |
| JourneyMap | Physical rails, shared-route colour bands, and station, platform and depot icons on the fullscreen map, with separate TRACKS and ROUTES controls. |

These are **map-only icons**, not ordinary Xaero waypoints: they do not fill the waypoint list, compass, minimap or in-world HUD. Multiple routes on one physical rail occupy adjacent colour bands rather than overwriting one another. Both map integrations draw physical rails first, coloured routes on top, and station/platform icons last. In JourneyMap, the entire layer follows the map's live drag and zoom transform; track width matches Xaero's screen-pixel style.

When the mod is installed on the server as well as the client, it can request a **whole-network snapshot** for each dimension. Without the server component it still works, but can show only the nearby data MTR has sent to the client. Xaero and JourneyMap are optional integrations; install either or both.

## Requirements and installation

| Minecraft | Loader | Java | MTR | Optional maps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.21.1 | NeoForge 21.1.x or Fabric + Fabric API | 21 | 4.1.0-beta.2 | Xaero's World Map 1.45.0+ / JourneyMap 6.0.8+ |
| 1.20.1 | Forge 47.x or Fabric + Fabric API | 17+ | >=4.0.5, <4.1 | Xaero's World Map 1.45.0+ / JourneyMap 6.0.6+ |
| 1.20.4 | Forge 49.x or Fabric + Fabric API | 17+ | >=4.0.5, <4.1 | Xaero's World Map 1.45.0+ / JourneyMap 5.10.0 |

Every dependency must match your Minecraft version and loader. Xaero's Minimap is optional and is only used to remove old `[MTR]` waypoints created by earlier releases.

1. Download **one JAR** matching your exact Minecraft version and loader from the latest release, [v1.5.1](https://github.com/teamCreating/MTR-Map-Overlay/releases/tag/v1.5.1), and place it in the client's `mods` directory. The release has six JARs: the original NeoForge/Fabric builds for 1.21.1 and four `MC1.20.1` / `MC1.20.4` Forge/Fabric compatibility builds.
2. Install MTR and your chosen map mod for that same loader. Fabric additionally needs Fabric API.
3. Optionally install the matching MTR Map Overlay JAR and MTR on the server to enable the whole-network view. Client and server must use the `mtrmap` mod ID; older `mtrsurveyor` builds are not compatible with this release.
4. Open Xaero's World Map or JourneyMap's fullscreen map. Both maps have matching `ROUTES` and `TRACKS` icons (green left bar = on, red = off); JourneyMap puts them in its add-on button panel. The `/mtrmap config routeLines` and `trackLines` switches apply to both maps. Hover over a line or icon for details.

The server component is optional. v1.5.1 fixes NeoForge dedicated-server startup by isolating client initialization. The 1.21.1 builds, shared tests and NeoForge dedicated-server startup passed; fullscreen visuals and cross-machine multiplayer still need further verification. All four MC 1.20 builds passed local development-runtime map and dedicated-server checks; production-JAR startup and cross-machine play remain unverified. See [release notes](https://github.com/teamCreating/MTR-Map-Overlay/releases/tag/v1.5.1) and the [MC 1.20 runtime QA](https://github.com/teamCreating/MTR-Map-Overlay/blob/compat/mtr-4.0-mc-1.20/docs/validation/mc120-runtime.md).

## Commands and configuration

Commands are registered on the **client**, so they are available even when the server does not run this mod.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/mtrmap syncRoutes` | Request a whole-network snapshot, if the server supports it. |
| `/mtrmap syncLandmarks` | Refresh JourneyMap landmarks. |
| `/mtrmap testMarker` | Place a JourneyMap diagnostic marker at the player. |
| `/mtrmap mode station\|platform\|both` | Select the client-data fallback landmark mode. |
| `/mtrmap config enabled <true\|false>` | Enable or disable the map overlay. |
| `/mtrmap config showStations <true\|false>` | Show or hide station icons. |
| `/mtrmap config showPlatforms <true\|false>` | Show or hide platform icons. |
| `/mtrmap config showDepots <true\|false>` | Show or hide depot icons. |
| `/mtrmap config routeLines <true\|false>` | Show or hide route ribbons on both maps. |
| `/mtrmap config trackLines <true\|false>` | Show or hide physical rails on both maps. |

NeoForge stores settings in `config/mtrmap.toml` and copies an existing `mtrsurveyor.toml` on first launch when the new file is absent. Fabric uses `config/mtrmap.properties` with its own defaults. The two formats are not automatically interchangeable. Important options include `networkSync.enabled` (default `true`), `networkSync.refreshIntervalSeconds` (default `300`), and the station/platform/depot visibility switches.

## Build from source

Use a Java 21 toolchain. The loader builds have separate Gradle wrappers because they use different build plugins:

The commands below build the **1.21.1 main branch**. Forge/Fabric 1.20.1 and 1.20.4 sources and build instructions are on the [MC 1.20 compatibility branch](https://github.com/teamCreating/MTR-Map-Overlay/tree/compat/mtr-4.0-mc-1.20).

| Loader | Windows | macOS / Linux | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NeoForge | `.\gradlew.bat build` | `./gradlew build` | `build/libs/CRTools-MTR-Map-Overlay-1.5.1.jar` |
| Fabric | `.\fabric\gradlew.bat -p fabric build` | `./fabric/gradlew -p fabric build` | `fabric/build/libs/CRTools-MTR-Map-Overlay-fabric-1.5.1.jar` |

The NeoForge build runs the shared JUnit tests. A successful build does not replace an in-game compatibility check, especially when Xaero's internal map renderer changes.

## Source guide

The NeoForge sources are under [`src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap); [`fabric/`](fabric) contains Fabric-specific entry points and adapters and compiles the shared Java sources. NeoForge keeps common initialization in `MTRMap` and physical-client events in `MTRMapClient`; `MTRNetworkClient` holds client-only transport callbacks. The two builds share textures, the 128×128 mod/pack logo, and the same `mtrmap` identity.

| Area | Main responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`mapdata/`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap/mapdata) | `MapDataCache` selects server snapshots or nearby MTR client data. `TrackSampler` samples each physical rail, reused by route paths; `TrackRoutePalette` assigns stable colour bands and `MapTrack` caches bounds for viewport culling. |
| [`network/`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap/network) | Protocol-v5 payloads and `NetworkSnapshotCodec` transfer routes, tracks and landmarks. `ServerNetworkCollector` reads MTR simulators on their own threads; `ClientNetworkSync` probes and requests snapshots, while `NetworkChunkAssembler` validates and reassembles chunks. |
| [`integration/xaero/`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap/integration/xaero) | `XaeroRouteRenderer` draws tracks, route ribbons and map-only icons in world-map coordinates and handles hover tooltips. |
| [`integration/journeymap/`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap/integration/journeymap) | Optional JourneyMap v2 plugin. `JourneyMapToolbar` supplies TRACKS/ROUTES buttons; `JourneyMapScreenProjection` follows pan/drag/zoom; `JourneyMapPathManager` draws viewport-culled pixel-width track and route quads; `JourneyMapForegroundRenderer` keeps landmark icons above both layers. Fullscreen `MarkerOverlay` objects retain hover information. |
| [`mixin/`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap/mixin) | Access to MTR data and the Xaero render hook; Fabric supplies its own Xaero hook variant. |
| [`config/`](src/main/java/com/lx862/mtrmap/config) and [`fabric/src/main/java/`](fabric/src/main/java) | Loader-specific configuration, initialization, client commands and network registration. |

Data flow: MTR simulator/client data → dimension-specific `MapDataCache` → Xaero or JourneyMap fullscreen renderer. With a modded server, the client first probes dimension hashes, requests changed snapshots, validates and reassembles chunked payloads, then updates the cache. Without one, the cache falls back to MTR's radius-limited client data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Only nearby stations appear:** the server has not supplied a whole-network snapshot. Install the matching mod on the server, or use the client-only fallback as intended.
- **No Xaero lines:** check that Xaero's **World Map** is installed and that the log contains `Path layer render hook into Xaero's World Map is active`. Xaero internal changes can break the render hook.
- **No minimap waypoints:** expected. Landmarks are intentionally fullscreen-map overlays.
- **Migrating from an older build:** replace the old `mtrsurveyor` JAR rather than installing it beside this one; the mod ID and command are now `mtrmap` and `/mtrmap`.
